"""
This function takes in an array of numbers and a target
integer, and returns the two numbers in the array that add
up to the target integer.

Arguments:
    nums (List[int]): A list of numbers
    target (int): A target integer. The function finds two integers
                  in nums that adds up to this integer.
Returns:
    An array of size 2 that contains the two numbers that add up
    to target that exist in nums.
Examples:
    [3,9,10,11], 19 => [9, 10]
    [3,3,6], 6 => [3,3]

Notes:
    - The numbers in the returned answer should be in increasing order
    - You can not use the same element of an array more than once.
    - You can assume that the input will always have a valid solution.
    - You can assume that there will only be one solution
    - You can assume the numbers will be positive and the array will not be empty
