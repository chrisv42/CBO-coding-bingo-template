# CBO Coding Challenge Question 1 - 5 points

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

For this problem, write a program that takes a semi-filled Sudoku board as input and outputs a solved Sudoku board.

You may assume that every given input board is a legal 9 x 9 board and solveable.
