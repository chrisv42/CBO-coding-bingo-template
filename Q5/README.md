# CBO Coding Challenge Question 5 - 1 point

Write a program that caclulates the median of a list of numbers. The median is defined as the value in the middle of a _sorted_ data set. For a list of odd length, this means the value that has equally as many numbers greater than it as numbers less than it. For a list of even length, it is the average of the two numbers that have that same property. For example:

* Median of the list [1,2,3,4,5] is 3 since there are 2 numbers in the list greater than 3 and 2 numbers less than 3.
* Median of the list [6,1,3,2,4,5] is 3.5 since the sorted list would be [1,2,3,4,5,6] and the two numbers in the middle are 3 and 4. The average of 3 and 4 is 3.5.
