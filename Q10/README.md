# CBO Coding Challenge Question 10 - 2 points

Create a function that takes `file_name` and `content` as parameters, and outputs a .txt file named `{file_name}.txt`. The contents of this text file should be `content`

Example usage:

create_text_file("this_file_name", "The secret number is 42")

Outputs a text file named "this_file_name.txt". When opened, the content found inside the file should be "The secret number is 42".
