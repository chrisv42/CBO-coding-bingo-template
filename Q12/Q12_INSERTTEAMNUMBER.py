"""
This function takes in a list of numbers and returns the 
median of all numbers. The median depends on the length of
the list. If the list is odd in length, the median is the
middle value of all values in the array. E.g.:

[5,2,3,4,1] -> median = 3

If the list is even in length, the median is the average between
the middle two values. E.g:

[1,3,2,4] -> median = (2 + 3) / 2 = 5/2 = 2.5

Arguments:
    list_of_nums (List[int] Array of integers): A list of the numbers
Returns:
    the median of all the numbers
Examples:
    [5,2,3,4,1] => 3
    [1,3,2,4] => 2.5
