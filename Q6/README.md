# CBO Coding Challenge Question 6 - 3 points

For this problem, you are given a dictionary that contains fast food menu items as keys and prices as their mapped values.

Using the given dictionary of food items and their prices, make an interactive ordering program.

You may use your imagination on the exact parameters of this game, but one basic example flow might be:

1. Asks the customer what they would like to order, providing a list of available items
2. After the customer selects an item, the current subtotal should be repeated to the customer, and the customer is asked if they would like to order anything else
