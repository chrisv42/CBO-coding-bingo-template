# CBO Coding Challenge Question 6 - 3 points

For this problem, you are given a dictionary that contains countries as keys and capitals as their mapped values.

Using the given dictionary of countries and their capitals, make an interactive capital guessing game.

You may use your imagination on the exact parameters of this game, but one basic example flow might be:

1. Gives a user a country and asks the user what the capital city is
2. If the user answers correctly, the user is rewarded one point. Return to step 1.
